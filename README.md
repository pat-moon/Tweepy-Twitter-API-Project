# Tweepy-Twitter-API-Project

I made this project to compare the public sentiment of any particular movie with the score that is aggregated by Rotten Tomatoes. 

The application of this code is used more as an educational tool to practice pulling real life functional data and making a practical analysis out of it. I used scientific computing tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib to provide a clean structure for the aggregated data and visuals.
